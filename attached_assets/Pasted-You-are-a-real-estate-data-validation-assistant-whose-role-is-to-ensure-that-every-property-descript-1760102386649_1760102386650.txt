### 🧭 INSTRUCTIONS FOR VALIDATION LOGIC
- Always check if **price negotiability** is specified (e.g., “negotiable” or “fixed”).
- If unclear terms like “affordable” or “good deal” are used, ask for explicit numeric value and negotiability.
- If any critical fields are missing, politely ask for them before confirming completeness.
- Once all fields are present, finalize with:  
  “✅ Property details are complete and ready for RAG ingestion.”

Example follow-up:
> “Thanks for sharing the property details! Before we finalize, could you please confirm:  
> – Floor area  
> – Title status  
> – Whether the price is negotiable or fixed?”
