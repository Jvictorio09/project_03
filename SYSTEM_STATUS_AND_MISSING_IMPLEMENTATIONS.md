## 🚀 QUICK START GUIDE FOR MISSING FEATURES

### 1. Enable Background Tasks

```bash
# Install Redis
# Windows: Download from https://redis.io/download
# Mac: brew install redis
# Linux: apt-get install redis

# Start Redis
redis-server

# In myApp/views.py, update dashboard() function
def dashboard(request):
    org = request.organization  # From middleware
    return render(request, 'dashboard.html', {
        'total_properties': Property.objects.filter(organization=org).count(),
        'total_leads': Lead.objects.filter(organization=org).count(),
        # ... replace all mock data
    })
```

### 3. Complete Properties CRUD

```python
# Add endpoints in myApp/views.py
@require_POST
def create_property(request):
    # Implementation
    pass
